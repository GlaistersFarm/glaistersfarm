These booking terms and conditions apply to all confirmed bookings.

We advise that you print these terms and conditions at the time of booking.

* Current Version: 1.0
* Last updated: 2021-09-12

### Introduction and references

This website is owned and operated by the owners of Glaisters Farm who shall be referred to as “we”, “us” or “our” in these terms and conditions.

To make it easier to read these terms and conditions there are a number of further definitions which we use:

* “Deposit” means a deposit of 20% of the total holiday accommodation cost. This includes any “extras” required at the time of booking.
* “Holidaymaker” means you and each person going on holiday with you on your booking.
* “Property” means Glaisters Farm.
* “You” means the lead person making a booking.
* "Us", "Our" and "We" means the owners of the property.

When you make a booking with us you are confirming that you and every Holidaymaker understands, agrees and accepts these terms and conditions. Please read them carefully, particularly section 13 headed “Limitation of Liabilities and Legal”.

#### 1. Contract and Booking

When you make a booking through us the contract to occupy the Property is between you and us.

Bookings cannot be accepted from persons under 18 years of age.

The Property is not meant to be used as a “party house”, and any bookings for stag and hen dos, may not be allowed unless special arrangements (including the possible requirement for a safety deposit) are made with Us.

No bookings are valid until confirmed by Us in writing (including by email).

Once a booking is confirmed it cannot be changed by you, unless agreed by us. If we agree to make the requested changes to your booking (for example, changing the lead booker and/or the dates of your holiday) these changes will be free of charge.

#### 2. Booking Fees, Deposits, Balance Payments and Holiday Insurance

When you make a booking you will be required to pay a Deposit and the balance will be due no later than 9 weeks before the holiday is due to start.

If you make a booking within 9 weeks of the start of the holiday you will be required to pay for the holiday in full at the time of booking.

We recommend you take out holiday insurance to cover any unforseen events.

We reserve the right to cancel your holiday and re-let any holiday where any payment due is more than 7 days’ late. In these circumstances you will not be entitled to any refund.

The Deposit is non-refundable unless we are unable to accept your booking or for some unforseen reason the Property is unavailable at the time of the holiday.

#### 3. Guest Cancellations
If you cancel prior to the holiday arrival date you may be due a partial refund.

The refund will depend on the amount of notice you give us before the holiday start date and will be calculated as follows:

* 21 or less days’ notice – No refund due
* 22-35 days’ notice – 10% of the total accommodation cost
* 36-49 days’ notice – 20% of the total accommodation cost
* 50-63 days’ notice – 40% of the total accommodation cost
* More than 63 days’ notice – your liability to pay the balance will be waived, however, the Deposit will not be refunded. If the holiday was paid in full and more than 63 days’ notice is provided then 2/3rds of the total accommodation cost will be refunded.

If a refund is due we will aim to return the applicable amount within 10 working days of cancellation.

#### 4. Holidaymakers’ responsibilities

You will ensure that you and all Holidaymakers will:

* Act responsibly and carefully whilst at the Property, abiding by any property specific house rules and leave the Property, and all things in or at it, in the same state of repair and cleanliness as at the start of the holiday.

Please see our [Privacy Policy](/privacypolicy) which explains how we will process your personal data.

All electronic data transferred pursuant to these terms and conditions remains our property and may not be replicated in part or whole without our prior written permission. Electronic data will not be preserved indefinitely by us.

#### 11. Limitation of Liabilities and Legal – Please pay particular attention to this section

The contract to occupy the Property is made on the basis that the Property is to be occupied by the Holidaymakers for a holiday (as mentioned in the Housing Act 1988 Schedule 1 paragraph 9 or similar legislation in other jurisdictions).

When making a booking, you acknowledge on behalf of all Holidaymakers that the tenancy granted by these terms and conditions is not an assured tenancy and that no statutory periodic tenancy will arise when it ends.

Once you have made a booking there is no “cooling off” period as the contract you have made is for accommodation services for a specific period of performance. You can see further details in the section “When you don’t get 14 days to cancel” on the citizen’s advice bureau website [here](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/changed-your-mind/cancelling-a-service-youve-arranged).

We accept no responsibility for personal injury to, or death of, Holidaymakers or anyone they invite to the Property, or loss of or consequential loss or damage to their property, or for other matters over which we have no control.

If you fail to comply with these terms and conditions you will be liable (only) for losses which are a foreseeable consequence of the failure to comply with the applicable terms. Losses are foreseeable where they were contemplated by you at the time you made the booking.

Nothing in these terms and conditions will limit our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so. This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or the negligence of our employees, agents or subcontractors, or for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.

Any dispute, claim or other matter which may arise in relation to your booking will be governed by English law and you agree that any dispute will be dealt with exclusively by the courts of England and Wales.
