As far as we can tell, the Farmhouse has stood at Glaisters for close to 100 years. However, when it was purchased in 2017 it was in desperate need of renovation and repair. Cue three years of hard graft, late nights and lots of overspend (after all, that’s what budgets are for). Glaisters Farm has had a complete refresh.

From new floors and a full re-wire to re-roofing, practically everything you can see (and lots of things you can’t) have been repaired, replaced or renovated. The farmhouse has been equipped to a high standard and to anticipate your needs by providing all the things you might want for a luxurious stay.  

## Lounge
Warm and cosy with seating for eight adults. Features a log burning stove and a flat screen TV.

There is a DVD player with a large number of DVDs including family and action films. There are a number of board games and books available to entertain you in the evenings.
