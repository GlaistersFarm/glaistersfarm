As far as we can tell, the Farmhouse has stood at Glaisters for close to 100 years. However, when it was purchased in 2017 it was in desperate need of renovation and repair. Cue three years of hard graft, late nights and lots of overspend (after all, that’s what budgets are for). Glaisters Farm has had a complete refresh.

From new floors and a full re-wire to re-roofing, practically everything you can see (and lots of things you can’t) have been repaired, replaced or renovated. The farmhouse has been equipped to a high standard and to anticipate your needs by providing all the things you might want for a luxurious stay.

## Lounge
Warm and cosy with seating for eight adults. Features a log burning stove and a flat screen TV.

There is a DVD player with a large number of DVDs including family and action films. There are a number of board games and books available to entertain you in the evenings.

## Dining Room and Kitchen
The dining room has a large table that can easily accommodate eight people.

The kitchen is extremely well equipped containing:

- an electric range cooker with three ovens and a grill,
- a large side-by-side fridge freezer with plenty of space,
- an integrated dishwasher,
- a four slice toaster, coffee machine, kettle and there is a microwave in the utility room.

## Bedrooms

The farmhouse has four well appointed bedrooms. Two are doubles with kingsize beds and superking duvets, one of these bedrooms is ensuite. Both double rooms have original fireplaces (not working). The remaining two bedrooms are twin rooms and one of these is on the ground floor. All the beds have luxurious memory foam topped mattresses and crisp, white bed linens.

### Ensuite Double

Relax in a kingsize bed, curl up with a good book in the rocking chair or wash away the day in the walk in shower in the ensuite bathroom. This bed room has beautiful views over the surrounding countryside.
